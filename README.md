### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed during lecture did prepare me to complete the assignment. Namely, the overview of how data is handled and passed as props in React was incredibly useful in creating my application. I did feel a bit unprepared when it came to creating more complex components that involve passing data with React, but, eventually, got the hang of it. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would attempt to make the fetching from the TMDB API faster and create a profile page to be able to see watched movies, favorited movies, etc. Additionally, I would have created more filters and possibly made a way for a user to add ratings. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Getting through all of the features and integrating the required & stretch features in visually appealing ways was very fun and went well. Data passing through props was something that I struggled with, but I eventually mastered it.
